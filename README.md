    Model Development for Push-Up Counting By Utilizing Body Landmarks and LSTM Algorithm
  </h1>
  <h2> Description</h2>
  <p>
    Building a model to classify and evaluate push-up movements by processing initial data in the form of videos using MediaPipe Pose to obtain body landmark data that is processed until it is ready to become a dataset for training. The result is the best model with an accuracy of 90.02% in testing. In addition to building the model, a simple simulation was also built using Python that runs in real time, and the test results with the simulation obtained an accuracy of 95.05%. Thus, the model can properly recognize and classify push-up movements.
